# printnc_qtdragon_hd_config

Work-in-progress.  This is an example config for LinuxCNC to demonstrate how to setup qtDragon with a PrintNC.  I found it difficult to find example configs for qtDragon that worked with PrintNC systems which use a parallel break-out-board (BOB) and Chinese spindle.  In addition, I could not easily locate a config example that demonstrated how to setup M6 remapping for use with a tool sensor.  This config will hopefully help others avoid the torture of figuring all this stuff out.  

Values to be added to the ini file.
